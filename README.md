# Controling-5-servos
# Here I used the Arduino devolvement board for three project:

**1 - control 5 servos to move 90 degree when turned on

The circuit was designed using tinkercad website, you can reffer to the picture for the connection and see the code provided with a file with the same name.


**2 - control 5 servo using 5 potentiameter (variable resistance) 

Here i used 5 varibale resistances to controll 5 servos using the arduino as a controller, you can see picture of the circuit diagram provided in this repositry and a file with the code with the same title (make sure to have the servo library installed)



**3-  using potentiometer to control a servo (physically)

For this project i just provided a video of the same circuit (controlling one servo using one variable resistance using arduino) you can use the same circuit diagram and the same code of the second project which using 5 servos and 5 resiatances but you need to make sure to adjust the pin number and delete the code part of the rest of the servos.
